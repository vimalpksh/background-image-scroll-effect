      <h1>The Winter Is Here!</h1>
      <p>
        Winter season in India refers to the period between November and
        February when the northern hemisphere is inclined away from the sun and
        hence sun rays have to travel a longer distance to reach the surface of
        the earth. The winter season is a magical time as the weather gets
        cooler and people, in general, enjoy the weather around them. As the
        mercury drops, people take out their warm clothes and get together in
        small gatherings lighting fireplaces and enjoying small talk around
        them.The vegetables available in the winter season are also fresh and
        taste better than the ones available during summer. People instead of
        avoiding the sun start waiting for the sun and enjoying its warmth.

        Even from the view of our culture, the winter season holds a special
        place. The winter season is generally the time when Monsoon has
        retreated, the water sources are full and the weather is very suitable
        for roaming around. People like to celebrate this weather along with
        their families and also enjoy festivities like Christmas and New Year.
        The season is good but not for everyone. The season creates a huge
        problem for all the homeless people, stray animals, and people who live
        in the hilly areas. In some parts of our country (especially the
        mountain regions), daily snowfall or rain can be witnessed during this
        time. It creates challenges for them to survive as the roads get blocked
        due to snowfall or heavy fog. That’s why they preserve their winter food
        throughout the year. So that they do not have to worry about it.
        However, life gets truly difficult in a few European countries as they
        face massive snowfall or blizzards during winter. Many people take
        vacations during this time and go to visit tourist destinations like
        Shimla, Manali, and Leh, etc. Many parts of our country even witness
        snowfall and overall the weather turns delightful. However, there are
        various concerns that come with the winter season like Pollution. Delhi
        has been witnessing a sharp rise in the pollution levels during the
        winter season which is mainly due to the depression columns formed
        around the area Delhi is geographically situated in. These challenges
        should be dealt with so that people can cherish the mild atmosphere and
        enjoy it the most during the winter season.
